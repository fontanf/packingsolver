Packing unequal rectangles and squares
There are currently 6 data files. 
These data files are the test problems used in: 
Packing unequal rectangles and squares in a fixed size circular container using formulation space search 
by C.O. Lopez and J.E. Beasley.
Computers & Operations Research, vol.94, 2018, pp106-117
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cor.2018.02.012 
The test problems are the files:
square1, square2, square3, rect1, rect2, rect3

The format of the square data files is:
number of squares (n), 3 values for the container radius
for square i (i=1,2,...,n) in turn:
   length of square side

The format of the rect data files is:
number of rectangles (n), 3 values for the container radius
for rectangle i (i=1,2,...,n) in turn:
   rectangle length, rectangle width
