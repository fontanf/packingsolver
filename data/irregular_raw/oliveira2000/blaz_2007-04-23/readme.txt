Description: 
2D Irregular data sets (BLAZ) from OLIVEIRA/GOMES/FERREIRA (2000) and HOPPER
Artificial data set, taken from Blazewicz et al (1993). The original data set contained non-polygonal pieces, 
which were converted to polygons containing the original pieces.
(Data sets: blaz1, blaz2) (note: blaz1 is also known as shapes2 in Oliveira et al (2000))
